## Abstract

This project applied supervised machine learning techniques to classify the sex of abalone (“M”, “F”, or “I”) using physical measurements from the UCI Abalone Dataset. Using PyCaret’s automated machine learning workflow, multiple classification algorithms were trained, tuned, evaluated, and compared, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, and KNN. The best-performing model on the test set was the SVM with Linear Kernel, achieving an accuracy of 0.5569, closely followed by Logistic Regression (0.5552) and Ridge Classifier (0.5525). Despite relatively low overall accuracy—reflecting substantial overlap in biological features across abalone sexes—the models demonstrated meaningful discriminatory ability for class 1 (“F”), with several models achieving recall above 0.80 and AUC values up to 0.74 (e.g., Random Forest AUC = 0.7406). Confusion matrix and ROC analysis indicate that classifying “infant” (I) and “male” (M) abalone remains significantly more difficult. Feature importance rankings consistently highlighted Viscera_weight, Whole_weight, Shucked_weight, and Height as the most influential predictors. Overall, this study demonstrates that even with limited separability in the underlying dataset, classical machine learning models—particularly linear SVM—can provide stable and interpretable performance for multi-class biological sex prediction, and that automated ML frameworks such as PyCaret offer an effective approach for rapid experimentation and evaluation on real-world datasets.
